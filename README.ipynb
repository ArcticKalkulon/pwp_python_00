Currently, $u^*$ is set to $0.01$ m/s as is done in the [CESM CAM3 slab ocean model](http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/atm-cam/docs/description/node37.html). In reality, $u^*$ is dependent on the relative velocity between the ocean surface and the ice; higher relative speeds would cause greater heat-transfer.
